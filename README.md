# Backpack Planning
Git Pages url: https://chadwickbrock25.github.io/backpacking/

In my personal traveling experience re-packing for a different city/climate each week was a tedious task. It required gathering many variables to decide on a structure of convicence, which becomes time consuming on a tight scheduled trip. The introductory function is to search the weather for potential hiking locations, next a multi-list function to plan what to bring when hiking, & future functionality will be scheduling the items used in tables by day, then creating a list of how to pack your bag daily.

The technology in this week old site is simply two text input boxes & four buttons. My API is OpenWeatherMap where the free version can search the current weather for a location, although my vision is to upgrade to historical data to provide the median conditions with dates as the parameters. Currently when inputting a city & country a table is created with the temperature/humidity as well as food/clothes recommendations. Two exciting successes were hiding the table div before the users specified a location & positioning the background image/video with the multitude of possible screen sizes. Adjusting the CSS for multiple screen sizes reminisces with my idea of different lens sizes of a camera & it provides more choices depending on the possible canvas size.

My unsolved problems revolve around importing adobe after effects graphics & animations as SVG files. I will continue to add functionality with more tables & lists, as well as making the weather table into an eye catching widget. The ordered list in the green box will be an animated hiker with scrolling informative text explaining the process.
